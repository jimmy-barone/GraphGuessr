A sample of server-side scripts from a Roblox graph-guessing game. Players are shown the graph of an equation in ℝ², or the graph of a surface in ℝ³, and they must select the correct equation of the graph, given four multiple-choice style options. Features some basic graphing calculator functionalities, including the ability to parse any equation that can be manipulated (algebraically) into the standard form of a plane. The string is normalized to the form Ax + By + Cz = 0, and the normal vector n̂ = <A, B, C> is extracted and used to graph the corresponding plane.
