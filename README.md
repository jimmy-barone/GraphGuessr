A sample of server-side scripts from a Roblox graph-guessing game. The objective of the game is exactly as it sounds: players are shown the graph of an equation in ℝ², or the graph of a surface in ℝ³,
and they must the correct equation given four multiple-choice style options. Features some basic graphing calculator functionalities, including the ability to parse a string containing any equation
that can be algebraically manipulated into the form Ax + By + Cz = 0, extract the normal vector n̂ = <A, B, C>, and graph the corresponding plane.
